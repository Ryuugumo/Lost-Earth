To install:
Update your lwjgl to lwjgl-2.8.4
(http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Update_LWJGL)
Install minecraftforge-universal-6.0.1.349
(http://adf.ly/673885/http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge-universal-6.0.1.349.zip)
Run then Close Minecraft
(this should make a mods folder in your .minecraft directory)
Put LostEarth into your mods folder
(.minecraft/mods should now have LostEarth.zip inside it)

!DISCLAIMER! if you have any problems try:
     A. installing from a fresh install of minecraft
     B. learning to read readme files

!WARNING! this distribution also contains the LostEarth's src DO NOT put LostEarthSRC.zip into your mods folder as it will not work

LEGAL:
I believe that all code is free and should be freely shared. Help yourself to my src and do as you will. If, however, you make any money from any of my src I would like it if you either share the wealth or list me in your credits.

I take no share of your responsibility however if after changing or taking my src you run into bugs, errors, or corrupted data. If I have time in my busy schedule, I might help you; however my help will not change the fact that I'm not responsible for your modified version.
!!!Give me at least 24 hours after submitting a querry to respond. If I don't respond after one week assume that I'm too busy to help.!!!
